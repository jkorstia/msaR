[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zachcp/msaR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zachcp/msaR) 
[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/msaR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=msaR)

## Basic Usage

msaR is a an [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) wrapper of the [BioJS MSA viewer](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa) javascript library. msa will pass alignments to the BioJS MSA and has a convenience function that will handle the following formats:

1. A character string which is interpreted to be a fasta file (opened by `ape::read.dna`)
2. A DNAbin class object (ape)
3. An XStringSet (Biostrings) including "DNAStringSet", "RNAStringSet", "AAStringSet", and "BStringSet"
4. An XMultiple Alignment (Biostings) including "DNAMultipleAlignment","RNAMultipleAlignment", and"AAMultipleAlignment"

Any of these types of objects can be passed to msaR to create an html widget. See [the online docs](https://zachcp.github.io/msaR/) for an interactive version of this widget.


```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(msaR)

# read some sequences from a multiple sequence alignment file and display
seqfile <- system.file("sequences","AHBA.aln", package="msaR")
msaR(seqfile)
```

## Customized MSAs

```{r}
msaR(seqfile, menu=F, colorscheme="nucleotide")
```

## Use as a Shiny widget

msaR can be used as a widget with the Shiny web application framework.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#In ui.R
msaROutput("msa", width="100%")

#In server.R
output$msa <- renderMsaR(
  msaR(seqfile)
)
```
